# Pandoc Citer Extension for Visual Studio Code

This extension provides autocompletion of citations stored in a bibtex file, for use with [pandoc-markdown](https://pandoc.org/) documents, along with auto-completion for [pandoc-crossref](https://github.com/lierdakil/pandoc-crossref) cross-references.

## Features

### Autocomplete citations

![Example of citation autocomplete](imgs/exmplCiter.gif)

- Citations follow the standard syntax recognized by [pandoc-citeproc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-citeproc), i.e.: 
    - Citation syntax: `@BibKey` or `[@bibKey]`
        + Typing '@' should automatically trigger the suggestion window to show up. If not, try `Ctrl + Space`.
        + The suggestion window (probably) won't trigger if the `@` is right after some text without a space, i.e. `text@` won't trigger the suggestions but `text @` will. This restriction was made so that typing an email address won't trigger the citation suggestions.
    - The YAML should contain the line 
    ```
    bibliography: [path/to/.bib]
    ```
    - The path/to/.bib can either be a single path, a list of paths enclosed by square brackets, or a bullet list of paths
    - The path/to/.bib can be either a relative or absolute path
    - Multiple bib files can be included if separated by comma, e.g. `[path/to/refsA.bib, path/to/refsB.bib]`

## Configuration

- `PandocCiter.CrossRefMode`
    + Type: String, either "full" (default), "minimal", or "none"
    + Function: This changes the detail shown during auto-completion of cross-references. Setting this to "none" will disable auto-completion of pandoc-crossref references.
- `PandocCiter.ViewType`
    + Type: String, either "inline" (default) or "browser"
    + Function: Changes how the suggested citations are shown
- `PandocCiter.RootFile`
    + Type: String, path to markdown file
    + Function: This is useful if there are multiple markdown files with one external master file containing the YAML header with the `bibliography: [path/to/bib]` entry. This avoids having to insert the bibliography YAML header into each individual file. 
- `PandocCiter.DefaultBib`
    + Type: String, absolute or relative path to bib file
        - Note: For relative paths, it will be assumed that the path is relative to the workspace folder
    + Function: This is useful if there is a default bib file that is preferred for all projects. This bib file will be loaded regardless of whether or not a YAML entry is included.
- `PandocCiter.UseDefaultBib`
    + Type: Boolean, default is `true`
    + Function: This should be a project-specific setting. It is useful when a DefaultBib is defined but you don't want it to be used for a specific project.
- `PandocCiter.ForgetUnusedBib`
    + Type: Boolean, default is `true`
    + Function: This will check if the bibliography YAML matches the watched bib files, and if any watched files are not in the YAML, then their suggestions will be removed.
        + For example, suppose two markdown files are opened but only one of them has a bibliography entry in their YAML header. If this config is set to `false`, then both markdown files will show citation suggestions. If this config is set to `true`, then citation suggestions will only be shown in the file with the bibliography YAML.
- `PandocCiter.ShowLog`
    + Type: Boolean, default is `false`
    + Function: This will show a log in the Output panel, useful for answering questions like "Why isn't the extension finding my bib file?". The Output panel can be accessed via `VSCode Top Menubar -> View -> Output` which will open a panel at the bottom. Select `PandocCiter` from the drop down list, and the extension's log should show up.
- `PandocCiter.CitationFormat`
    + Type: String array
    + Function: Controls which bibtex fields will be shown in the suggestions window, along with their order

## Acknowledgements

- This extension started out as a a stripped down version of the [LaTeX-Workshop extension](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop) that has been adjusted for markdown/pandoc
    + The structure of the `src` directory was preserved, so that any updates/fixes here could also be ported to LaTex-Workshop, and vice versa
